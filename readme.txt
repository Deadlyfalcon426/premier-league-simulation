Ok so lowkey here we have some premier league simulation thing here okay 
here are the factors for winning and losing
1. if you win you keep winning
2. if you score goals, you win more often :)
3. if you they score goals on you, you lose more often :(
heres some stuff i might add:
if you beat someone good, that says more about you than beating up spurs
if you play at home, you are more likely to cook, and vice versa for away games
include luck yk?
maybe ref bias lol, cause i already have match reports with ref names
